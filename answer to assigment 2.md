# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
is a discipline that applies engineering principles and techniques to the design development , testing and maintenance of software system

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
is a process that involves the development .testing and deployment of software application to solve real world problem
software engineering involves systematic approach to software development 
traditionsl programming focus primarily on writting code
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
agile ia flexible and iterative approach while waterfall is more structural and liner approach, agile is often used in a project with rapidly changing requirement while watrefall is often used in project with well-definded and fixed requirements


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
agile preferred; project with high degree of complexity of uncertainly
                 project with rapidly changing requiremnets
                 proof of concept development
                 project in industries with fast-paced innovation
waterfall prefrred ; project with a low risk of changes or surprises
                     project with a clear and straght forward scope 
                     project with well-defined amd fixed requirements 
                     project that involves regulatory or complioance requirement                  
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining the requirement of a software systems 
the main goal are; to understand the problem that the software system is intended to solve
                   to define the quality attributes of the system
                   to define the functionality that the system must provied 
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a large software to system into smaller. 
easier maintenance; with modular design ,changes can be made to individual modules without affecting the entire system reducing the risk of introducing new bugs or breaking existing functionality
improved scalability; modular systemcan be easily extended by adding new modules allowing the system to grow and evelve as needed           
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
unit testing ;testing individual software components such fucntions,methods or classes
intergratin testing ;testing how differentsoftware components work together to ensure seamless intergration
system testing ; testing the entire software system to ensure it meets the requirements and work as expected
acceptance testing ;to ensure the software meet the user  acceptsnce criteria and is ready for deployment  

 Why is testing crucial in software development
to help identify and fix defects ,bugs,and errors ,resulting in high-quality software that meets user expections

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
version system control are system control tools that help manage changes to code document or other digital content.
assign unique version or revisions to changes 
popular version control system; Git
                                perforce
                                azure devOps
                                mercurial
                                subversion
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
software manager plays a crucial role in leading and managing software development teams,project and processes
key responsibities; project planning
                    team management
                    quality assurance
                    technical guidance
 challenges faced ;managing conflict                   
                   pressure to deliver
                   team turnover
                   resource allocation
Software Maintenance:


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
software maintanance is a process of modifying,updating and fixing software 
types of maintainance; corrective maintainance identify and fix errors,bugs and faults
                       adaptive maintenance updates software to adapt to changes in the environment
                       perfective maintence enhances softwareby adding new features
software maintenance is essential for; reliability and stabilty
                                       improves perfomance 
                                       reduce downtime
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
ethical issues; privacy
                security
                intellectual property
                safety
software must be aware of the potential consequences of their work and strive to develop software that benefit society and respect users rights
